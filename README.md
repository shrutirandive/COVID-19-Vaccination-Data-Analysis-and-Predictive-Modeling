# COVID-19 Vaccination Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 vaccination data in the United States. The project focuses on employing advanced statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms to gain insights and make accurate predictions regarding the total number of vaccinations administered.

## Project Highlights:
Data Source: The dataset used in this project encompasses crucial features such as location, vaccination metrics, and population statistics.

Data Preprocessing: Rigorous data preprocessing methodologies have been implemented, including interpolation and zero-filling, to ensure dataset accuracy and integrity for subsequent analysis.

Predictive Models: The project involves the development and evaluation of predictive models using various regression techniques. Notable achievements include a 98.62% accuracy rate for Linear Regression, 97.52% for MLP Regressor, and 88.32% for Random Forest Regressor in forecasting total vaccinations.

Regularization Techniques: To prevent overfitting and optimize model performance, a range of regularization techniques including Elastic Net, Ridge, and Lasso have been applied.

AutoML Integration: AutoML (H2O) has been employed for automated model selection. The Gradient Boosting Machine emerged as the most effective model, showcasing superior predictive capabilities.

Model Interpretability: Advanced techniques such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations), and partial dependence plots have been utilized for detailed model interpretation. These techniques provide granular insights into feature importance and their impact on predictions, offering a comprehensive understanding of the underlying relationships within the data.
